Python Programming 
I decided I wanted to incorporate a new language into my skill set so I went with python. I started with OpenSuse Leap 43 running on virtual box.  I purchased the book "Python Crash Course" by ematthes the book is very well written for new and experienced programmers, I only wanted to learn it so I can use it for scripting in linux administration. the book has some projects in it alien invasion is a very good project to learn how it all works together but after that some of the projects lack updates so I am now learning web scraping and django on youtube which is at location "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&index=1&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK"
